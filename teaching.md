I have had the great fortune of teaching a variety of classes during my undergraduate and graduate careers, in capacities ranging from teaching assistant to instructor. Through my teaching, I strive to make the classroom a more welcoming place for all students, and particularly shy students who often are overlooked in traditional classroom formats. I have found that simple acts, such as brief, individual interactions with each student periodically throughout a semester, can have a noticeable positive impact on their enjoyment of and engagement with the course.
