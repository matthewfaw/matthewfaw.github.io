I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate in the ECE department at The University of Texas at Austin, where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Sanjay Shakkottai](https://sites.google.com/view/sanjay-shakkottai/) and [Constantine Caramanis](https://caramanis.github.io/).

Prior to joining UT Austin, I spent four fun years at Duke University, where I graduated with majors in Electrical & Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics. During my time there, I had the great fortune of working with <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~leebcc/index.html">Ben Lee</a> on designing economically sustainable algorithms for datacenter-level computational sprinting, <a href="http://microfluidics.ee.duke.edu/">Richard Fair</a> on designing digital microfluidic devices capable of manipulating cells within a droplet, and <a href="https://buchlerlab.wordpress.ncsu.edu/">Nick Buchler</a> on using CRISPR technologies to create cells which perform logical operations.

I've also spent some time in industry. During the summer of 2016, I was a software engineering intern at <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/">MathWorks</a> on the Stateflow Semantics team, where I developed a new code generation framework. Between undergrad and grad school, I also spent a year working as a software engineer at a healthcare software startup called <a href="https://verato.com/">Verato</a>, where I co-developed a continuous integration platform on Kubernetes and wrote code to maintain and update the identity data in the company's main database.

In my free time, I enjoy running and biking, and have completed the <a href="https://runsuperseries.com/supermarathon">2022 Super
Marathon</a> and the <a href="https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon">2023 Boston
Marathon</a>.
