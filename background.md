I am an ARC Postdoctoral Fellow at Georgia Institute of Technology, working with [Siva Theja Maguluri](https://sites.google.com/site/sivatheja/home) and [Sahil Singla](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~ssingla7/).

Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I completed my Ph.D. in the ECE department at The University of Texas at Austin, where I was very fortunate to be advised by [Sanjay Shakkottai](https://sites.google.com/view/sanjay-shakkottai/) and [Constantine Caramanis](https://caramanis.github.io/).
Before that, I received my bachelor's degree at Duke University, where I graduated with majors in Electrical & Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics. During my time there, I had the great fortune of working in several research labs:
- **Datacenter Architecture**, Advisor: [Ben Lee](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~leebcc/index.html), *January-December 2016*
    - Evaluated performance and economic viability of several strategies for system-level computational sprinting for Spark applications. 
    - Worked on extensions for co-locating batch and latency-critical workloads.
- **Microfluidics**, Advisor: [Richard
  Fair](http://microfluidics.ee.duke.edu/), *January-December 2015*
    - Designed and fabricated digital microfludic devices capable of manipulating E.coli using magnetic beads within droplet to conduct small-scale biology experiments.
- **Synthetic Biology**, Advisor: [Nick Buchler](https://buchlerlab.wordpress.ncsu.edu), *May-November 2014*
    - Conducted molecular titration experiments to evaluate several CRISPR-based techniques for creating an ultrasensitive response in gene expression.
    - Designed 3D-printed lab equipment to lower financial barriers to biology research.

I've also spent some time in industry. During the summer of 2016, I was a software engineering intern at [MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com) on the Stateflow Semantics team. Between undergrad and grad school, I also spent a year working as a software engineer at a healthcare software startup called [Verato](https://verato.com/):

- **Software Engineer**, *[Verato](https://verato.com/)*, McLean, VA, *June 2017-July 2018*
    - Co-designed and built a custom continuous integration system using Kubernetes, capable of testing hundreds of simultaneous builds of the software stack.
    - Designed software to maintain 300M entry Mongo database and Solr search engine.
- **Software Engineering Intern**, Stateflow Semantics Team, *[MathWorks](https://www.mathworks.com/)*,
  Natick, MA, *May-August 2016*
    - Co-designed and implemented a proof-of-concept architectural change to the teamâ€™s code generation process that allowed product extensibility and optimizations that were previously infeasible.

In my free time, I enjoy running and biking, and have completed the <a href="https://runsuperseries.com/supermarathon">2022 Super
Marathon</a> and the <a href="https://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon">2023 Boston
Marathon</a>.
