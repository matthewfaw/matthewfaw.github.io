-  During my freshman year, I worked in a synthetic biology lab, where we worked to use CRISPR and molecular titration techniques to demonstrate ultrasensitive responses in E.coli cells as a proof-of-concept for building biological circuits to perform logical operations. I also designed some 3D-printed lab equipment to help make biology lab equipment more affordable/accessible, and co-designed and taught the first ever house course on synthetic biology at Duke! Our team won a <a href="{{ site.data.links.otherprojects.igem.website }}">gold medal</a> at the <a href="{{ site.data.links.otherprojects.igem.competition }}">International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition</a>! You can learn more about our project <a href="{{ site.data.links.otherprojects.igem.website }}">here</a>!
- During my undergrad, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of fun projects. A couple of notable examples: For an advanced linear algebra course, I wrote a survey on <a href="{{ site.data.links.otherprojects.linalg.coxeter }}">Finite Coxeter Groups</a>. For a software design course, I led a group of ten students to implement a <a href="{{ site.data.links.otherprojects.software.vooga }}">video game authoring environment</a>. 
- In my free time, I enjoy discovering new music. I've written an app to send Slack messages whenever Pitchfork announces best new music, available <a href="{{ site.data.links.otherprojects.software.pitchfork }}">here</a>. I also wrote an app that <a href="{{ site.data.links.otherprojects.software.spotify }}">logs my Spotify listening history</a> and <a href="{{ site.data.links.otherprojects.software.relationships }}">plots graphs of artist relationships</a>.
- During the summer of 2020, I modified my Rancilio Silvia espresso machine to (i) have
  automatic temperature control, (ii) to turn on and off on a schedule, and (iii) to be
  controlled via a website and Slack. Surprisingly, it still works! You can find my code <a href="https://github.com/matthewfaw/silvia-pi">here</a>.
