I am an ARC Postdoctoral Fellow at Georgia Institute of Technology, working with [Siva Theja Maguluri](https://sites.google.com/site/sivatheja/home) and [Sahil Singla](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~ssingla7/).

Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I completed my Ph.D. in the ECE department at The University of Texas at Austin, where I was very fortunate to be advised by [Sanjay Shakkottai](https://sites.google.com/view/sanjay-shakkottai/) and [Constantine Caramanis](https://caramanis.github.io/).

Before that, I received my bachelor's degree from Duke University, where I graduated with majors in Electrical & Computer Engineering, Computer Science, and Mathematics. During my time there, I had the great fortune of working with <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~leebcc/index.html">Ben Lee</a> on designing economically sustainable algorithms for datacenter-level computational sprinting, <a href="http://microfluidics.ee.duke.edu/">Richard Fair</a> on designing digital microfluidic devices capable of manipulating cells within a droplet, and <a href="https://buchlerlab.wordpress.ncsu.edu/">Nick Buchler</a> on using CRISPR technologies to create cells which perform logical operations.
