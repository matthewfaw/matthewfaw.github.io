My interest lie broadly in the design and analysis of stochastic optimization and online learning algorithms. I am particularly interested in studying the power and limitations of adaptive algorithms, and in understanding the settings where adaptivity gives provable performance guarantees over non-adaptive algorithms. These interests have lead me to study a variety of problems, including variations of multi-armed bandits, (limited information) prophet inequalities, (adaptive) optimization algorithms, and domain adaptation problems.
