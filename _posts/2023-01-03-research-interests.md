My interests lie broadly in the design and analysis of stochastic optimization and sequential decision-making algorithms.
I am particularly interested in: 
- The power and limitations of adaptive optimization algorithms ([i]({{ site.data.links.colt22.proceedings }}),[ii]({{ site.data.links.colt23.proceedings }}))
- Online algorithms (e.g., prophet inequalities) and learning with [limited
  information]({{ site.data.links.soda22.proceedings }}) and [dynamic
  feasiblity constraints]({{ site.data.links.sigmetrics22.journal }})
- Fairness in sequential decision-making, and decision-making in the presence of [biased feedback]({{ site.data.links.icml25.biasedbandits }})
- [Time-series forecasting]({{ site.data.links.icml25.tfm }})
<!--I am particularly interested in studying the power and limitations of adaptive algorithms, and in understanding the settings where adaptivity gives provable performance guarantees over non-adaptive algorithms. These interests have lead me to study a variety of problems, including (adaptive) optimization algorithms, multi-armed bandits, (limited information) prophet inequalities, and domain adaptation.-->
