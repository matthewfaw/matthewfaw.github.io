<h2>About Me</h2>
<div id="sec-about">
I am a second-year Ph.D. student in the ECE department at The University of
Texas at Austin, where I am very fortunate to be advised by 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sanjay-shakkottai/">Sanjay Shakkottai</a>
and 
<a href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~cmcaram/constantine_caramanis/Home.html">
    Constantine Caramanis</a>.
<br><br>

Prior to joining UT Austin, I spent four fun years at Duke University, where I
graduated with majors in Electrical & Computer Engineering, Computer Science,
and Mathematics. During my time there, I had the great fortune of working with 
<a href="http://people.duke.edu/~bcl15/index.html">Ben Lee</a> on designing
economically sustainable algorithms for
datacenter-level computational sprinting, 
<a href="http://microfluidics.ee.duke.edu/">Richard Fair</a> on 
designing digital microfluidic devices capable of manipulating cells within a droplet, and 
<a href="https://buchlerlab.wordpress.ncsu.edu/">Nick Buchler</a> on using
CRISPR technologies to create cells which perform logical operations.
<br><br>

Outside of school, I've also spent time in industry. During the summer of 2016,
I was a software engineering intern at 
<a href="https://www.mathworks.com/">MathWorks</a> on the Stateflow Semantics
team, where I developed a new code generation framework. Between undergrad and
grad school, I also spent a year working as a software engineer at a healthcare
software startup called <a href="https://verato.com/">Verato</a>, where I co-developed
a continuous integration platform on Kubernetes and wrote code to maintain and
update the identity data in the company's main database.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<div id="sec-research">

My interests include online learning, optimization (both convex and
non-convex), adaptive data analysis, and transfer learning.
Lately, I've been using ideas from convex optimization and
bandits to develop algorithms to correct for distribution shift. I've 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10154">recently discovered</a> that convex
optimization and continuous-armed bandit setups provide a really useful
framework for studying covariate shift (and its generalizations), and believe
that optimization and online learning will provide useful approaches to
studying and designing algorithms with theoretical guarantees for a wide range 
of problems in transfer learning.

            Mix and Match: An
            Optimistic Tree-Search Approach for Learning Models from Mixture
            Distributions</a>
  <br>Matthew Faw, Rajat Sen, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Constantine Caramanis, and Sanjay Shakkottai.
<br>In submission.
<br>Summary:
<ul>
    <li>We introduce a new framework to handle distribution shift, assuming
        access to a small validation dataset. Our assumption on distribution
        shift is more general than covariate shift, and accommodates latent
        variables. 
    <li>Our assumptions naturally motivate formulating the problem
    in the continuous-armed bandit framework and using an optimistic
    tree-search algorithm to account for distribution shift.</li>
    <li>Our analysis
        requires high-probability bounds on the error of the final iterate of
        SGD. We prove <i>new bounds</i> on the error of the
        final SGD iterate that <i>do not require a global stochastic gradient
            bound</i>!</li>
    <li>We validate our theoretical results on three Kaggle datasets (an
        Allstate insurance dataset, a wine ratings dataset, and Amazon employee
        access dataset). 
        The code to run the experiments and create the datasets can be found 
        <a href="https://github.com/matthewfaw/mixnmatch">here</a>.</li>
    <li>All experiments were run on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud.
        Code to create the experimental setup is avaliable 
        <a href="https://github.com/matthewfaw/mixnmatch-infrastructure">here</a>.</li>

<h2>Other Projects</h2> 
<div id="sec-otherproj">
<ul>
    <li> During my freshman year, I worked in a synthetic biology lab, where we
        worked to use CRISPR and molecular titration techniques to demonstrate
        ultrasensitive responses in E.coli cells as a proof-of-concept for
        building biological circuits to perform logical operations. I also
        designed some 3D-printed lab equipment to help make biology lab
        equipment more affordable/accessible, and co-designed and taught the
        first ever house course on synthetic biology at Duke! Our team

            a gold medal</a> at the

            Engineered Machine Competition</a>! You can learn more about our
        project <a href="http://2014.igem.org/Team:Duke">here</a>!</li>
    <li>During my undergrad, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of fun
    projects. A couple of notable examples: For an advanced linear algebra course, I wrote a survey on 
    <a href="https://github.com/matthewfaw/papers/blob/master/math/coxeter-groups-mcf28.pdf">
    Finite Coxeter Groups</a>. For a software design course, I led a group of
    ten students to implement a
    <a href="https://github.com/matthewfaw/voogasalad_voogabonds">video game
        authoring environment</a>.
    </li>
    <li>In my free time, I enjoy discovering new music. I've written an app to
    send Slack messages whenever Pitchfork announces best new music, available 
    <a href="https://github.com/matthewfaw/best-new-music-tracker">here</a>. I
    also wrote an app that 
    <a href="https://github.com/matthewfaw/spotify-scrobbler"> 
    logs my Spotify listening history</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/matthewfaw/spotify-data-analysis">plots graphs of
    artist relationships</a>.</li>

<h2>Teaching</h2> 
<div id="sec-teaching">
I have had the great fortune of teaching a variety of classes during my
undergraduate and graduate careers, in capacities ranging from teaching
assistant to instructor. Through my teaching, I strive to make the classroom a
more welcoming place for all students, and particularly shy students who often
are overlooked in traditional classroom formats. I have found that simple acts,
such as brief, individual interactions with each student periodically
throughout a semester, can have a noticeable positive impact on their enjoyment
of and engagement with the course.
