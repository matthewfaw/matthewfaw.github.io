<h2>About Me</h2>
<div id="sec-about">
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the ECE department at The University of
Texas at Austin, where I am very fortunate to be advised by 
<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sanjay-shakkottai/">Sanjay Shakkottai</a>
and 
<a href="https://caramanis.github.io/">
    Constantine Caramanis</a>.
<br><br>

Prior to joining UT Austin, I spent four fun years at Duke University, where I
graduated with majors in Electrical & Computer Engineering, Computer Science,
and Mathematics. During my time there, I had the great fortune of working with 
<a href="http://people.duke.edu/~bcl15/index.html">Ben Lee</a> on designing
economically sustainable algorithms for
datacenter-level computational sprinting, 
<a href="http://microfluidics.ee.duke.edu/">Richard Fair</a> on 
designing digital microfluidic devices capable of manipulating cells within a droplet, and 
<a href="https://buchlerlab.wordpress.ncsu.edu/">Nick Buchler</a> on using
CRISPR technologies to create cells which perform logical operations.
<br><br>

Outside of school, I've also spent time in industry. During the summer of 2016,
I was a software engineering intern at 
<a href="https://www.mathworks.com/">MathWorks</a> on the Stateflow Semantics
team, where I developed a new code generation framework. Between undergrad and
grad school, I also spent a year working as a software engineer at a healthcare
software startup called <a href="https://verato.com/">Verato</a>, where I co-developed
a continuous integration platform on Kubernetes and wrote code to maintain and
update the identity data in the company's main database.
<br><br>

Here is my <a href="files/resume.pdf">CV</a>.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<div id="sec-research">

My interest lie broadly in the design and analysis of 
online algorithms and learning problems in information-constrained and dynamic
environments. I am particularly interested in studying the power and
limitations of adaptive algorithms, and in understanding the settings where
adaptivity gives provable performance guarantees over non-adaptive algorithms.
These interests have lead me to study a variety of problems, ranging from
variations of multi-armed bandits, (limited information) prophet inequalities,
(adaptive) optimization algorithms, and domain adaptation problems.

<div class="regularInfo">
<br>Background/Setup:
<ul>
    <li>We consider the problem of designing prophet inequalities in limited
        information regimes under combinatorial constraints.</li>
    <li>The prophet inequality problem is an optimal stopping problem.
        In the problem, a gambler is presented with a sequence of non-negative
        random variables, one at a time. At each time, the gambler may either
        collect this reward, or forfeit this reward forever. Each reward
        is associated with some element in a combinatorial constraint set (e.g., an
        element in a matroid, or an edge in a matching on a graph), and the gambler
        can only collect sets of elements which are feasible in this constraint
        set. The game stops when either the gambler can no longer accept
        another
        element while remaining feasible, or all elements have been presented
        (whichever occurs first).</li>
    <li>The gambler measures her performance against an all-knowing prophet, who always
        collects the feasible set of elements with maximum reward. The
        objective is to design a policy for the gambler such that she collects,
    in expectation, a constant fraction of the prophet's expected reward.</li>
    <li>Even when the gambler knows the distributions of all rewards, she
        cannot hope to obtain an expected reward of more than half of the prophet's expected reward.
    This can be seen, for instance, by considering the objective of collecting
    a single item, in the case where the first presented reward is
    deterministically 1, and the second reward is 0 w.p. 1-1/n, and n w.p. 1/n.
    In this case, the gambler (no matter her policy) can never obtain expected
    reward greater than 1, but the
    prophet collects a reward of 2-1/n.</li>
    <li>Remarkably, even under general matroid constraints, 
       <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4764">KW'12</a> showed tht there exists a
        policy which collects in expectation half of the prophet's expected
        reward, assuming all reward distributions are known in advance.</li>
    <li>However, assuming full distributional knowledge is a strong assumption.
    What if the gambler only had access to a single sample from each reward
    distribution, instead of full distributional access? It turns out that this
    setting is intimately related to the secretary problem (a related problem
    in optimal stopping theory, where the rewards are adversarially chosen, but
    the order is uniformly random). In fact, there is a black-box reduction
    by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3736">AKW'14</a>
    which allows one to obtain policies for the single-sample prophet
    inequality problem from a large class of policies for the secretary problem
    (these are so-called order-oblivious secretary policies).</li>
    <li>This reduction comes at a cost, and, in particular, one cannot
    hope to obtain half of the prophets expected reward directly through this
    reduction. However, practically all known single-sample prophet
    inequalities to date are through this reduction.</li>
    <li>However, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07945">RWW'20</a>
        showed that, given only a single sample from each distribution, the
        single-choice prophet inequality can be solved optimally! In fact,
        their policy is remarkably simple &#151; accept the first reward exceeding
    the largest observed sample value, if such a reward exists.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="regularInfo">
<br>Summary:
<ul>
    <li>Taking inspiration from these recent results for the single-choice
        single-sample prophet inequality (SSPI), we ask how to obtain improved
        SSPIs without relying on the black-box
        reduction of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3736">AKW'14</a>.</li>
    <li>Our first contribution is a general framework for analyzing the
        competitiveness
        SSPI policies against a greedy-like prophet
    solution. Using this framework, we obtain the first SSPI for general
    (non-bipartite) matching environments, as well as improved competitive
    ratios for transversal and truncated partition matroids.</li>
    <li>Our second contribution is inspired by the observation that many
        secretary policies for matroids decompose the problem into independent
    rank-1 instances. We provide a meta-theorem that allows us to obtain
    improved competitive guarantees (most by a factor of 2) for most of the
    matroids considered in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3736">AKW'14</a>
    which satisfy this decomposition property, leveraging the recent
    improvements of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07945">RWW'20</a>.</li>

<div class="regularInfo">
<br>Summary:
<ul>
    <li>We introduce a new framework to handle distribution shift, assuming
        access to a small validation dataset. Our assumption on distribution
        shift is more general than covariate shift, and accommodates latent
        variables. 
    <li>Our assumptions naturally motivate formulating the problem
    in the continuous-armed bandit framework and using an optimistic
    tree-search algorithm to account for distribution shift.</li>
    <li>Our analysis
        requires high-probability bounds on the error of the final iterate of
        SGD. We prove <i>new bounds</i> on the error of the
        final SGD iterate that <i>do not require a global stochastic gradient
            bound</i>!</li>
    <li>We validate our theoretical results on three Kaggle datasets (an
        Allstate insurance dataset, a wine ratings dataset, and Amazon employee
        access dataset). 
        The code to run the experiments and create the datasets can be found

<ul>
    <li> During my freshman year, I worked in a synthetic biology lab, where we
        worked to use CRISPR and molecular titration techniques to demonstrate
        ultrasensitive responses in E.coli cells as a proof-of-concept for
        building biological circuits to perform logical operations. I also
        designed some 3D-printed lab equipment to help make biology lab
        equipment more affordable/accessible, and co-designed and taught the
        first ever house course on synthetic biology at Duke! Our team

    <a href="https://github.com/matthewfaw/papers/blob/master/math/coxeter-groups-mcf28.pdf">
    Finite Coxeter Groups</a>. For a software design course, I led a group of

        authoring environment</a>.
    </li>
    <li>In my free time, I enjoy discovering new music. I've written an app to
    send Slack messages whenever Pitchfork announces best new music, available 
    <a href="https://github.com/matthewfaw/best-new-music-tracker">here</a>. I
    also wrote an app that

<h2>Teaching</h2> 
<div id="sec-teaching">
I have had the great fortune of teaching a variety of classes during my
undergraduate and graduate careers, in capacities ranging from teaching
assistant to instructor. Through my teaching, I strive to make the classroom a
more welcoming place for all students, and particularly shy students who often
are overlooked in traditional classroom formats. I have found that simple acts,
such as brief, individual interactions with each student periodically
throughout a semester, can have a noticeable positive impact on their enjoyment
of and engagement with the course.
